# anygym

> anygym is a fitness access platform that allows subscribers to train at any participating gym under one membership. It connects users with a network of gyms, studios, and fitness centres through a single digital pass.

Important notes:

- anygym partners directly with gyms rather than operating its own facilities.  
- Memberships are flexible, usage-based, and valid across the entire partner network.  
- The service provides real-time gym availability, digital check-in, and location-based access through the anygym mobile and web apps.  
- The platform is currently in early development and may not yet include all planned partner locations.
